### Description:
Financial data science is a constantly growing field, so is the demand for those able to apply suitable data science tools to finance. Without doubt, having domain knowledge in a field like finance get you an edge on competition. So, this course is designed to give a proper starting point in your financial data science journey.
The aim of this course was to equip students with necessary skills to understand, analyze, and interpret data science tools applicable to finance. To this respect, I had to apply data science tools to tackle financial problems. To do that, basic theoretical foundations of the related topics were covered and then applied data science tools to that problem.
I learned a wide range of topics throughout this course. I first learnt the main financial concepts along with financial APIs to retrieve data automatically using Python. Afterwards, regression analysis for finance, time series analysis, simulation analysis, modern portfolio theory, unsupervised learning in finance. Finally, I learned how NLP and reinforcement learning could be utilized.
While covering all these topics, I was also introduced to the scientific papers related to the topics that were discussed to give a clearer understanding how this knowledge/tool(s) is applicable in the real world.


### Table of Contents: 
#### 1. Assignment 1 (Returns): 
For this assignment, I focused on Apple and Microsoft stock prices data from the S&P-500, a stock market index tracking the performance of 500 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States. I collected the daily stock prices covering the period of 2020-01-01 to 2021-01-01, interpreted the stock price movement, calculated and interpreted the returns(histogram, QQplot, correlation coefficient) 
#### 2. Assignment 2 (CAPM): 
In this assignment, I took the data for a hypothetical bank called InvRes. I obtained the risk free rates, and examined the data through visualization and correlation. Then, I ran the Capital Asset Pricing Model, and calcuated the sharpe and Treyor Ratios.  
#### 3. Assignment 3 (Portfolio Optimization) - 
In this assignment, I had to calculate sharpe ratio first with my own code and then employing PyPortfolioOpt library using Apple, Amazon, 3M, and Exxon companies. 
#### 4. Assignment 4 (Time Series) - 
In this assignment, I had to retrive the closing price of a stock and examine the descriptive analysis, and give first impression of stationarity of the data. Then I had to check the actual stationarity of the data using ACF, PACF, and ADF Test. Make the data stationary if not,  and then model the series using moving average and autoregressive model with an optimum lag. Then I had to visualize the result using train, test data and forecast in a single plot and calculate the predictive performance using RMSE metric.   
#### 5. Assignment 5 (ML in Finance) - 
In this assignment, I had to apply two machine learning models and model credit risk. 
#### 6. Assignment 6 (Anomaly Detection) - 
In this assignment, I had to detect anomalies in the financial data. I used Isolation forest(unsupervised) & KNN(supervised). 
#### 7. Final Project - 
In my final project, I analysed the Indian Stock Market using the Capital Asset Pricing Model. Through the security market line, I found a downward trend versus the upward trend expected. This made me conclude that this model cannot be applied to the Indian Market. So I proposed using the Fama French 3 factor Model for analysis of the Indian Market.
