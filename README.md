# Description:
Financial data science is a constantly growing field, so is the demand for those able to apply suitable data science tools to finance. Without doubt, having domain knowledge in a field like finance get you an edge on competition. So, this course is designed to give a proper starting point in your financial data science journey.
The aim of this course was to equip students with necessary skills to understand, analyze, and interpret data science tools applicable to finance. To this respect, I had to apply data science tools to tackle financial problems. To do that, basic theoretical foundations of the related topics were covered and then applied data science tools to that problem.
I learned a wide range of topics throughout this course. I first learnt the main financial concepts along with financial APIs to retrieve data automatically using Python. Afterwards, regression analysis for finance, time series analysis, simulation analysis, modern portfolio theory, unsupervised learning in finance. Finally, I learned how NLP and reinforcement learning could be utilized.
While covering all these topics, I was also introduced to the scientific papers related to the topics that were discussed to give a clearer understanding how this knowledge/tool(s) is applicable in the real world.


Course Learning Objectives :
• Be familiar with the financial concepts
• Understand theoretical background of main financial topics such as time series analysis, simulation, asset pricing
• Apply regression analysis in the financial context
• Understand the portfolio theory
• Apply unsupervised learning techniques to financial issues
• Be aware of recent advancements in financial data science
